# Java Swing

UPD: Initial title was "How to build desktop app in 2024".

Initially I have tried to make "Hello, World!" app using:

* `Electron` - no, it's too complex to work with background worker;
* `Neutralinojs` - no, I have problems with samples compiling and running.

Other possible declined options:

* `Qt` is not an option, because I do not want to use C++;
* `WinForms/WPF/UWA/UWP` is not an option, because I do not want to return to C#;
* `Tkinter` or `PyQt` is not an option because I do not want to use Python for such complex application.

Selected options:

* `AWT` is OK for first MVP. I already have some examples and small experience with it after `Java: The Complete Reference, Twelfth Edition 12th Edition by Herbert Schildt`;
* `Swing` is "legacy" technology too, but it's OK for me. Some experience and basic examples from book as well. It's good for beginning.

So `Swing`. But more knowledge is needed:

* Few free chapters of [Java Swing by Robert Eckstein, Marc Loy, Dave Wood](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/java-swing/156592455X/ch01s04.html);

* [Creating a Custom Swing Component
](https://jhippjava.blogspot.com/2011/11/creating-custom-swing-component.html) - it's waste of time;
* [CodeProject: UI Component Development in Java Swing - Part 1: Design](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/62099/UI-Component-Development-in-Java-Swing-Part-1-Desi) - unfortunately, there is only first part;

UPD: After a while, the quality of the code and its testing began to cause pain. I decided to try to "do everything on the web that can be done there." So...vanilla Java server and almost vanilla JavaScript client.
